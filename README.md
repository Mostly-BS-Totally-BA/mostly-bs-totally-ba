* Setting:
	* Game is based in a dungeon or tower, with multiple levels going up and/or down.

	* These levels will contain different enemies types / themes to prevent the game from feeling redundant.

Add-Ons
=========
* Each boss fight will have different mechanics. This is to add variety to the game so that bosses feel unique and provide a challenge for the player to overcome.
* Ability to solve puzzles, and interact with objects in game such as opening a chest to find loot.
* Functioning inventory system where you can see items you have picked up throughout the game, and possibly use said items.
* Procedurally generate maps, so that every time a player starts a game it is a never before seen map, this will make memorizing the game maps nearly impossible.
* Provide readable text on the screen that will pop up at various points. Each time it will provide more context to the story of the game so that the player can feel involved in the game world.
* Multiple Player Classes, such as Rogue, Warrior, Wizard who have different weapon/attack functionality.
* Addition of an in game map, to track where the player is and where they have/haven’t been yet.


User Story:
             “I want to be able to play an old style game that feels nostalgic, such as The Legend of Zelda. The game should have some basic common functionality, including a user interface, and options to start a new game or save and load an existing game. Concerning gameplay, the character I am controlling needs to move freely in four directions and have a short and long range attack. Each level needs to contain a variety of basic enemies with a mini boss, all of which the character will need to attack to kill. I want to be able to advance to different levels of increasing difficulty. Finally, I want to defeat a challenging end boss that hopefully leaves me with a sense that I accomplished something.”
