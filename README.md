Gameplay:

* Player Functionality:
	* The player controls a character that will be able to move, attack enemies of different types.
	* The player will have the option to choose between using a melee or ranged attack to defeat enemies.
* Setting:
	* Game is based in a dungeon or tower, with multiple levels going up and/or down.
	* A minimum of 5 levels will exist with the game difficulty increasing for each.
	* These levels will contain different enemies types / themes to prevent the game from feeling redundant. 
* Enemies / Boss:
	* The final level will contain the final game boss that the player needs to defeat in order to beat the game. 
	* The levels will increase in difficulty as the player progresses, with the first level being the easiest and the final boss being the hardest. 
* User Interface:

	* When the player beats the game, or if the player decides to exit the game, they will be able to do so with an option screen to take them back to the main menu.





Add-Ons
=========
* Each boss fight will have different mechanics. This is to add variety to the game so that bosses feel unique and provide a challenge for the player to overcome.
* Ability to solve puzzles, and interact with objects in game such as opening a chest to find loot.
* Functioning inventory system where you can see items you have picked up throughout the game, and possibly use said items.
* Procedurally generate maps, so that every time a player starts a game it is a never before seen map, this will make memorizing the game maps nearly impossible.
* Provide readable text on the screen that will pop up at various points. Each time it will provide more context to the story of the game so that the player can feel involved in the game world.
* Multiple Player Classes, such as Rogue, Warrior, Wizard who have different weapon/attack functionality.
* Addition of an in game map, to track where the player is and where they have/haven’t been yet.


User Story:
============
“I want to be able to play an old style game that feels nostalgic, such as The Legend of Zelda. The game should have some basic common functionality, including a user interface, and options to start a new game or save and load an existing game. Concerning gameplay, the character I am controlling needs to move freely and have at least two different types of attacks. Each level needs to contain a variety of basic enemies with a mini boss, all of which the character will need to attack to kill. I want to be able to advance to different levels of increasing difficulty. Finally, I want to defeat a challenging end boss that hopefully leaves me with a sense that I accomplished something.”
