User Story:
============
“I want to be able to play an old style game that feels nostalgic, such as The Legend of Zelda. The game should have some basic common functionality, including a user interface, and options to start a new game. Concerning gameplay, the character I am controlling needs to move freely,attack, and defeat enemeies. A level needs to contain a variety of basic enemies with a boss, all of which the character will need to attack to kill. I want to be able to be able to finish a level that provides me a sense of accomplishment."
